# Task Management Tool

Taking Action. Tools in this category can be used to take action in a software system, such as sending an email, 
creating a new record in a database, submitting a form, or triggering a workflow. The goal is to automate tasks 
that would otherwise require human intervention or explicit programming. For example, a tool can be used to book a flight 
for a customer interacting with a chatbot, to fill out a form on a web page, or to implement a Java class based on an 
automated test (TDD) in a code generation scenario.
