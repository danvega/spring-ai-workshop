# Weather Tool

Information Retrieval. Tools in this category can be used to retrieve information from external sources, such as a 
database, a web service, a file system, or a web search engine. The goal is to augment the knowledge of the model, 
allowing it to answer questions that it would not be able to answer otherwise. As such, they can be used in 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. For example, a tool can be used to retrieve the current weather 
for a given location, to retrieve the latest news articles, or to query a database for a specific record.
